# QUT Motorsport - Steering Wheel

## THIS PROJECT HAS BEEN DEPRECATED, FUTURE WORK WILL BE CONDUCTED AT QUTMS_SteeringWheel_V2
QEV1's Steering Wheel Board, which this repo coresponds to suffered from critical failure when the 5V linear regulator died. This prompted the team to begin work on a new design for QEV2, which can be found at [QUTMS_SteeringWheel_V2](https://github.com/QUT-Motorsport/QUTMS_SteeringWheel_V2).

### What?
A 'dumb' output terminal that acts as a digital dashboard for the car.
### Why?
To display information from the Chassis Controller (originating from various car sensors and systems) to the driver.
### How?
The steering wheel receives information over CANBUS from the Chassis Controller and displays the information relevant to the currently selected mode on a digital display. There will be two cylindrical switches that can be rotated to set the program to different modes allowing for the driver to view different sets of information on the display at will.
### Where?
A digital display in the steering wheel of the car that receives and displays information from other car systems to the driver.
### Who?
*Insert anyone who has worked on the software here.*
