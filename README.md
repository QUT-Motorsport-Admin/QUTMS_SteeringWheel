# QUT Motorsport - Steering Wheel

### What?
A 'dumb' output terminal that acts as a digital dashboard for the car.
### Why?

### How?
The steering wheel receives information from the Chassis Controller and displays the information relevant to the currently selected mode on a digital display. There will be two cylindrical switches that can be rotated to set the program to different modes allowing for the driver to view different sets of information on the display at will.
### Where?
A digital display in the steering wheel of the car that receives and displays information from other car systems to the driver.
### Who?
*Insert anyone who has worked on the software here.*
